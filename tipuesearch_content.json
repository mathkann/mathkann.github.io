Effective Python by Brett Slatkin is a book that I wish had been available long ago. There are 59 tips organized into 8 different chapters. The idea is you choose which topic you want to read about. The organization is neat and effective …(pun unintended) For me, coming to Python from a Java / C# background, it was always a matter of just writing Python code that works … No best practices or patterns, just write anything that works. The thing is Python is very forgiving and one has many different ways to achieve the same goal. Any time my code was slow, it was easy to just blame it on Python. But the beauty of Python is it has many libraries and tools available for whatever one wants to use it for. And a programming language cannot be judged just on its performance but more importantly on how expressive it is and how it helps the developers to make efficient use of their time. While there are reasons for why Python is slow , there is no reason why one cannot try to write effective and elegant code. That is where Effective Python is a great help. I could go on and try to explain what is in the book, but check out the book's website and the code snippets from the book in Github for more info.","title":"Effective Python - A Quick Review"}]}
